- The 1960 shown as the data for the odds is wrong. The data that needs to be shown there is the prize of the user related to their rebate%. What has been shown instead is the bonus group.
- Also the lost amount is wrong and irrelevant. Wrong because it is showing the prize amount instead of the user's bet amount that they lost. Irrelevant because a bet status of lost, shows the user has lost the bet amount they wagered. So repeating that data is irrelevant. 


2.  Check the bet order ID shown at the frontend and backend
- Frontend Order ID - B990DEF49620240916
- Backend Order ID - 861145480520240912
They are different. This should never happen. A bet ticket cannot have different Bet Order ID at the frontend and backend.
