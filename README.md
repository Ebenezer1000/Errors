- The 1960 shown as the data for the odds is wrong. The data that needs to be shown there is the prize of the user related to their rebate%. What has been shown instead is the bonus group.
- Also the lost amount is wrong and irrelevant. Wrong because it is showing the prize amount instead of the user's bet amount that they lost. Irrelevant because a bet status of lost, shows the user has lost the bet amount they wagered. So repeating that data is irrelevant.
